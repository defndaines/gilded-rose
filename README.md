# Gilded Rose

A Clojure implementation of the Gilded Rose kata
([Original](https://iamnotmyself.com/2011/02/13/refactor-this-the-gilded-rose-kata/))
using [clara-rules](https://github.com/cerner/clara-rules).

I think I first came across Jim Weirich's
[version](https://github.com/jimweirich/gilded_rose_kata), and I'll likely
steal test ideas from there.
